The problem is about Insertion sort. Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm where you sort a dataset by "inserting" the numbers from the second card
and inserting them into the left cards so as to make the left cards a sorted set.
the time complexity for this algorithm is O(N^2) and its space complexity is O(1).
